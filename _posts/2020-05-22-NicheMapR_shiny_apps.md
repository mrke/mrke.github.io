There are now Shiny apps for the for the <a href="http://bioforecasts.science.unimelb.edu.au/soil/">microclimate</a> and <a href="http://bioforecasts.science.unimelb.edu.au/ectotherm/">ectotherm</a> models that run using a monthy long-term average climatology for the globe (function 'micro_global' in the package).

It is a good way to get a feel for what the models do and can be used for teaching exercises.
