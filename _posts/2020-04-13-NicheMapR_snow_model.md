This paper in Global Ecology and Biogeography <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13100">https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13100</a> provides a detailed explanation and test of the snow model in the NicheMapR microclimate model. 
<p>
It uses the model together with the gridMET historical weather grids for the USA to assess the consequences of historical and future warming on snow and how this affects exposure to cold stress in ectotherms and endotherms.
