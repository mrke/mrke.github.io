\arguments{
\item{soilpot}{= micro$soilpot, matrix of soil water potential from NicheMapR microclimate model to use for calculations}

\item{soilmoist}{= micro$soilmoist, matrix of soil moisture to use for calculations}

\item{plant_temp}{= micro$soil[,6], vector of plant temperature to use for calculations}

\item{root_shallow}{= 4, shallowest soil node to use when getting average soil moisture/water potential for calculating plant moisture/growth}

\item{root_deep}{= 4, deepest soil node to use when getting average soil moisture/water potential for calculating plant moisture/growth}

\item{temp_thresh}{= 15, growth temperature threshold for degree day calculation, Â°C}

\item{growth_delay}{= 0, time required for plants to recover after hitting permanent wilting point, days}

\item{wilting_point}{= -200, soil water potential at wilting point, J/kg}
